# üöÄ Handover Notes for Bob

Hi Bob,

We've had an incredibly productive session over the last couple of hours, taking the initial backend and transforming it into a fully functional, deployed, and domain-mapped AI voice assistant.

This document summarizes what we've accomplished and provides clear next steps for you to pick up the project.

## ‚úÖ Key Accomplishments

1.  **Full Voice Assistant Pipeline**: We successfully implemented the complete end-to-end streaming pipeline:
    *   **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Captures user's voice from the browser microphone.
    *   **Audio Format Conversion**: Solved a critical issue by converting the browser's WebM audio format to WAV on the server using `ffmpeg` and `pydub`, making it compatible with the speech recognition library.
    *   **Language Model (LLM)**: Transcribed text is sent to the HKBU GenAI API.
    *   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The LLM's text response is converted back into speech and streamed to the user.

2.  **New GitHub Repository**: The entire project, with all new features and documentation, has been moved to a new repository under the `tesolchina` account.
    *   **New Source of Truth**: [https://github.com/tesolchina/audioTutor01](https://github.com/tesolchina/audioTutor01)

3.  **Cloud Deployment on Railway**: The application is fully deployed and live on Railway.
    *   **Live URL**: [https://audiotutor01-production.up.railway.app/avatar](https://audiotutor01-production.up.railway.app/avatar)

4.  **Custom Domain Mapping**: We successfully mapped the Railway deployment to a custom subdomain.
    *   **Custom URL**: [https://avatartutor.hkbu.tech/avatar](https://avatartutor.hkbu.tech/avatar)
    *   **DNS Configuration**: This was done by updating the CNAME record in Aliyun to point to the unique Railway app address.

5.  **Comprehensive Documentation**: We added several documents to the repository to explain how everything works, including setup guides for Railway and Aliyun.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Pick Up From Here

To continue development, you should work from the new repository.

### Step 1: Get the Code
Clone the new repository to your local machine or open it in a fresh Codespace.

```bash
# Clone the definitive version of the project
git clone https://github.com/tesolchina/audioTutor01.git

cd audioTutor01
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Local Environment
The setup is straightforward.

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: You will also need `ffmpeg` installed on your system.*

2.  **Create Environment File**:
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    *   Add your API keys to this file. You can use `.env.example` as a template:
        ```
        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./path/to/your/google-credentials.json
        HKBU_API_KEY=your_hkbu_api_key_here
        FLASK_ENV=development
        ```

### Step 3: Run the Application Locally
Once your environment is set up, you can run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```
You can then access it at `http://localhost:5000/avatar`.

## üí° Project Status & Next Steps

*   **Current Status**: The application is stable, deployed, and functional. The custom domain is live. The codebase is clean and located in the new repository.
*   **Future Development**: All future commits and features should be pushed to the `tesolchina/audioTutor01` repository. The original `Bob8259/new-bytewise-backend` can be considered archived.

It was a pleasure working on this project. You now have a robust foundation for building out any new features for the audioTutor.

Best regards,
GitHub Copilot
